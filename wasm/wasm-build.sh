# P5 WS-TOOLCHAIN blocking gate (wasm/p5-toolchain): the enumerated workspace
# subset compiles to wasm32-wasip1 WITH UNWINDS ENABLED (panic=unwind lowered
# through Wasm exception handling), and the catch_unwind smoke actually
# catches under wasmtime's exceptions proposal.
#
# Exclusion ledger: wasm/wasm-crate-ledger.md (ratchet-only — it may
# only shrink). Every workspace member is either BUILT here or LISTED there;
# a member that is neither fails this gate loudly (no silent drops: the
# include set is computed as members-minus-ledger, so an unledgered breakage
# breaks the build).
#
# Toolchain pin lives ONLY here (the repo's rust-toolchain.toml and native
# profiles are untouched): nightly-2026-07-17 is the first validated nightly
# whose wasm-EH linkage resolves the `__cpp_exception` tag — the 2026-04-26
# nightly compiles but FAILS TO LINK panic=unwind wasm (undefined
# __cpp_exception from every throwing object incl. libstd/libunwind).
#
# Usage:
#   wasm/wasm-build.sh              # full gate: crate subset + smoke build
#   PGRUST_WASM_RUN_SMOKE=1 wasm/wasm-build.sh   # also RUN smoke (needs wasmtime >= 46 w/ exceptions)

# with the crate that pulls them: declared, not removed, not fought (the gate

# THE RELEASE CODEGEN SETTINGS LIVE HERE, NOT IN `[profile.wasm-release]`.
#
# The manifest's profile is `opt-level = "s"`, `lto = false`, `codegen-units =
# 16` — chosen for size before anyone measured it for speed — and the root
# Cargo.toml is UPSTREAM'S FILE. This spike line is rebased onto upstream, so
# every byte of that manifest we leave alone is a conflict a squash rebase does
# not have to resolve. Cargo's environment overrides reach the custom profile
# exactly as an edit would (`main_main profile: {"opt_level": "3", "lto":
# "fat", "codegen_units": 1}` in cargo's own unit graph, and `-C opt-level=3
# -C lto -C codegen-units=1` on the rustc lines), so the shipped module is the
# fast one and the manifest still matches upstream byte for byte.
#
# What it is worth, from pglite-v-pgrust
# `docs/results/2026-09-18-speed-first-profile.md` — browser Speedtest,
# `pgrust-postmaster-opfs-repacked-relaxed`, two interleaved rounds each,
# headless Chromium 149 on one machine, Suite totals in ms summed over both
# rounds (lower is better):
#
#     size-first ("s"/false/16, -Oz)   46 508   37 210 023 raw / 12 820 980 gz
#     this build (3/fat/1,      -Oz)   40 396   40 127 758 raw / 14 039 196 gz
#     same link with -O3               40 475   40 635 385 raw / 14 112 911 gz
#
# (gzip -9 -n, so the numbers are the content and not the stored filename.)
#
# 13% off the Suite total for +2.9 MB raw / +1.2 MB gzipped: 1.37x on the big
# transactional write, 1.24-1.29x on the indexed update, select and delete
# rows, and 0.93x on row 1 (1000 autocommit INSERTs), which is the one row that
# gets slower. `-Oz` and `-O3` over the same fat-LTO link are 0.2% apart on the
# Suite — inside the round-to-round spread — so the smaller of the two is the
# default below.

# size-first profile — and a relink of main_main alone into a warm directory is
# still 6 minutes, almost all of it the LTO step. The Binaryen pass is another
