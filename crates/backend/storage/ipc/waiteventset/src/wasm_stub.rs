// wasm32 backend (P5 boot increment). wasm32-wasip1 is single-threaded and
// socketless: there is no wake pipe (no pipe(2)), no fd to watch for a
// latch, and no second thread that could set a latch while this one blocks.
// Readiness therefore degenerates to time:
//   * poll (timeout 0)  -> nothing is ever ready, return "timeout";
//   * timed wait        -> sleep the full interval (poll_oneoff clock via
//                          std::thread::sleep), then "timeout";
//   * infinite latch wait -> a genuine deadlock on this target -- reported
//                          as a clean ERROR, never a hang.
// Socket events cannot be registered (no sockets on WASI p1); latch and
// postmaster-death registrations are position bookkeeping only (the death
// event is inert by construction in one address space, and the latch fast
// path lives in the generic wait_loop, which re-checks is_set before and
// after every block).
